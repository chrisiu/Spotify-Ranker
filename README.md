# Album Ranker 

Flask app to rank album tracks by pariwise comparisons. 

## Overview
This repository contains a small Flask app (`app.py`) and a simple frontend (`static/main.js`, `templates/index.html`) that lets you search albums (Deezer API) and rank tracks.

## Motivation 
On social media, users often rank songs from new albums, creating tier lists or track rankings. Instead of manually sorting tracks, which can be a difficult process, the app provides an interactive way to create those rankings by comparing two songs at a time until a complete ranking emerges. The goal is to provide music lovers with a quick, game-like tool for ranking tracks.
